Radio Frequency Identafication

Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is the wireless non-contact use of radio frequency waves to transfer data. RFID systems usually comprise an RFID reader, RFID tags, and antennas.

* How RFID Works?
  * Tagging items with RFID tags allows users to automatically and uniquely identify and track inventory and assets. RFID takes auto-ID technology to the next level by allowing tags to be read without line of sight and, depending on the type of RFID, having a read range between a few centimeters to over 20+ meters.

* Types of RFID :
  * Within the Electromagnetic Spectrum, there are three primary frequency ranges used for RFID transmissions â€“ **Low Frequency(LF)**, **High Frequency(HF)**, and **Ultra-High Frequency(UHF)**.

      * LF 
        * These range from 30 KHzto 500 KHz, though the typical frequency is 125 KHz. LF RFID has short transmission ranges, generally anywhere from a few inches to less than six feet.
        
      * HF
        * These range from 3 MHzto 30 MHz, with the typical HF frequency being 13.56 MHz. The standard range is anywhere from a few inches to several feet.
      * UHF
        * UHF RFID systems. These range from 300 MHz to 960 MHz, with the typical frequency of 433 MHz and can generally be read from 25-plus feet away.

      * **Microwave RFID systems**. These run at 2.45 Ghzand can be read from 30-plus feet away.
      
  The frequency used will depend on the RFID application, with actual obtained distances sometimes varying from what is expected. For example, when the U.S. State Department announced it would issue electronic passports enabled with an RFID chip, it said the chips would only be able to be read from approximately 4 inches away. However, the State Department soon received evidence that RFID readers could skim the information from the RFID tags from much farther than 4 inches -- sometimes upward of 33 feet away.
